# Project - Handwritten Digit Recognition with LeNet5 Model in PyTorch

# Introduction
Handwritten digit recognition is a key challenge in computer vision and machine learning. In this project, we aim to develop the LeNet-5 model using PyTorch to identify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Our objective is to create a highly accurate digit recognition system capable of classifying digits with high precision.

# Flow Of Project
