# Project - Handwritten Digit Recognition with LeNet5 Model in PyTorch

# Project Overview
The MNIST dataset is a benchmark in the field of computer vision and machine learning. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits. Our goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify these digits. We use the LeNet-5 model, a pioneering convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, implemented with PyTorch.
